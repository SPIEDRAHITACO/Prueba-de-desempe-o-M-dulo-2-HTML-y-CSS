# Prueba-de-desempeño-Modulo-2-HTML-y-CSS

Below you will find a replica of a landing page called Clipboard. The following link was used as a reference: https://www.figma.com/design/hw5hfbrYc2SDWhcBjZeVqV/Responsive-Landing-Page-Design-%7C-Website-Home-Page-Design-%7C-Agency-Website-UI-Design--Community-?node-id=0-1&p=f&t=cGtDkgo8FHt4Z8E6-0

This project consists of applying all the knowledge acquired during module two, based on replicating a landing page, an exercise that was already practiced during the simulation.

The main characteristic is that the landing page must be replicated by adding different animations and integrating images, while maintaining the same appearance as the original.

This repository contains two files: one with the entire HTML structure,

and the other with all the CSS design elements. It also includes a folder

containing all the images implemented in this replica.
